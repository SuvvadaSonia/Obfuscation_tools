# Obfuscation_tools

### 24-02-2023

Worked on Tool: Nuitka, Cryptography

Version: Python3.11

* Nuitka is a powerful tool for optimizing and distributing Python applications, and it can be especially useful for performance-critical applications or applications that need to be distributed to machines that may not have Python installed.

No key management or password management in nuitka itself

* Cryptography is a popular library for secure communication and encryption in Python. It is compatible with Python 3.6 or later versions. It supports several cryptographic algorithms and protocols, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, key derivation, and more.
* Done POC on Encryption and Decryption of Python Source Code with dynamic key using Cryptography.


### 27-02-2023

Worked on Tool: Pyinstaller

Version: Python3.8

* Pyinstaller is a popular Python packaging tool that converts Python scripts and modules into standalone executables. 
PyInstaller does not provide built-in code obfuscation or anti-debugging measures, it can be used in conjunction with other tools or techniques to enhance the security of your Python application. 


### 28-02-2023

Worked on Tool: Pyprotect

Version: Python3.8, 3.10, 3.11

* Getting module error even on different versions and pyprotect installed too.


### 01-03-2023

Worked on Tool: PyArmor

Version: Python3.8

* PyArmor is an open-source Python obfuscator and license manager that can be used to protect your Python scripts from reverse engineering and unauthorized use.
The free version of PyArmor is a great option for small projects or personal use, while the commercial version offers more advanced features and support for larger projects or enterprise environments.


### 02-03-2023

Worked on Tool: Cryptography

Version: Python3.11

* Worked on POC of Cryptography to run python files with key and without showing Source code.


### 09-03-2023

Worked on Tool: Pyminifier

Version: Python3.8

* Pyminifier is a Python code obfuscation tool that reduces the size of Python code by removing whitespace and comments, and renaming variables to make them more difficult to understand. 


### 10-03-2023
